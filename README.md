# REACT FUNDAMENTALS

## Lesson 01: Why React?

### What is Declarative Code?

Is the following code imperative or declarative?

```html
const people = ['Amanda', 'Geoff', 'Michael', 'Richard', 'Ryan', 'Tyler']
const longNames = people.filter(name => name.length > 6)
```

SOLUTION:
Declarative

### Unidirectional Data Flow

A FlightPlanner component stores the information for booking a flight. It also contains DatePicker and DestinationPicker as child components. Here's what the code might look like:

```
<FlightPlanner>
  <DatePicker />
  <DestinationPicker />
</FlightPlanner>
```
If this were a React application, which component(s) should be in charge of making updates to the data? Check all that apply.

 
* FlightPlanner

 
* DatePicker

 
* DestinationPicker

SOLUTION:
`FlightPlanner`
